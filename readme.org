* A DNS-Server process watchdog

This project implements a simple DNS server process watchdog. It sends
DNS queries to a local DNS server projects and writes the results to
syslog.

If the queries are failing, it will terminate with an error code. A
script can then pickup the error code and take an appropriate action
(like restarting the DNS server process).

This projects is currently /work in progress/, additional
documentation will be available soon.
